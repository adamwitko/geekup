Challenge 2 - Fresh Fish
========================

Your friend in Grimsby has decided to market fresh fish from his van to other UK cities.  His van is capable of carrying up to 200 kg of fish. For the first trip he has 50kg of Cod, 100kg of Octopus and 50kg of Crab, but he wonders where he should sell this catch for the maximum profit?

This prices in different local markets are:

£ / kg	Nottingham (800km)	Glasgow (1100 km)	Leeds (600km)
Cod	500			450			600
Octopus	0			120			100
Crab	450			0			500

The cost of petrol as £2 for each kilometer travelled
The purchase value of the load reduces by 1% for every 100 kilometers traveled as the seafood starts to degrade.
