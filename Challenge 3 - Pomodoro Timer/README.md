Challenge 3 - Pomodoro Timer
============================

You are required to develop a Pomodoro Timer - a simple kitchen timer shaped like a tomato!

The Pomodoro Technique is used in time management to create periods of focus on a particular task.

CREATING A TIMER
- A Pomodori is 25 minutes by default, but can be created with any duration
- A break is 5 minutes by default, but again could be adjusted
- After 4 Pomodori are completed an extended break of 15 to 30 minutes is taken

STOPPING A TIMER
- If during the Pomodori a task is interrupted, then the timer is stopped and reset so that it starts again with the full duration
- A Pomodori ends when the time runs out

You may also want to consider adding a User Interface to control the timer
